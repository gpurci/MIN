Among the applications of GRASP we mention the JSS problem [13], the graph planarization
problem [142] and assignment problems
Squeaky Wheel Optimization (SWO)

VNS and its variants have been successfully applied to graph based CO problems such as the p-Median
problem [80], the degree constrained minimum spanning tree problem [143], the Steiner tree problem [168]
and the k-Cardinality Tree (KCT) problem

Successful applications of ACO include the application to routing in communication networks [36],
the application to the Sequential Ordering Problem (SOP) [62], and the application to Resource Constraint
Project Scheduling (RCPS)
